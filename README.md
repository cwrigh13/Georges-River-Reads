# Georges River Reads

Georges River Reads is a multicultural reading app designed to connect the diverse communities of the Georges River area with their local libraries through fun, gamified reading challenges.

## üìç Project Status

This project is currently in the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** development phase. The core features are being built to validate the concept and gather initial user feedback.

## üìñ About The Project

Georges River Reads is a community-focused web application inspired by platforms like Beanstack, but tailored specifically for the vibrant, multicultural residents of the Georges River Local Government Area in Sydney, Australia.

Our mission is to break down language barriers and foster a lifelong love of reading by creating an engaging, accessible, and culturally relevant platform. The app serves as a digital bridge, connecting families and individuals to the rich resources of Georges River Libraries, promoting local events, and celebrating the diverse languages that make our community unique.
